# The-Movies-Database-TMDB

The Movies Database (TMDB) dataset was the subject of a really interesting and educational project I completed. Although it was somewhat related to data science, it was really more of a data analytics project and it was very interesting. Through working on that project, I was able to pick up very useful skills like performing EDA on datasets, creating visualisations of various plots to draw conclusions, and learning new codes and functions in pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

In this project I've pulled the data from the website"https://www.themoviedb.org/" dataset using my own API Key ,most of the data was very disorganized and I had to work on the stringified data. Then by using pandas I performed Explanatory Data Analysis & Data Presentation on various factors like - The best and the worst Movies,Finding the next Movie,What are the most common Words in Movie Titles and Taglines?,Are Franchises more successful?,Most Successful Actors and Working with Pandas and SQL Databases(Movies Dataset).

Then I used graphics such as piecharts, barplots, lineplots, pairplots, heatmaps, etc. to visualise these results. Also discovered trends, recognised significant business issues, and came to conclusions on each of the following elements based on visuals.
